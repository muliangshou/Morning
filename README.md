# Morning
People with busy or irregular schedules, such as students, freelancers, and stay-at-home parents, find it difficult to make time to improve mental health and maintain self-care routines. Our application aims to solve this problem by allowing users to schedule self-care routines into their day, giving users a sense of reward through showing achievements, helping them build good habits, and allowing them to also schedule activities with their friends, making self-care fun and social.
